## 1.0 Vision and Strategic Positioning

The Bay of Bengal platform is strategically positioned as a premier digital bridge, connecting the vast manufacturing and trading capabilities of Bangladesh and its neighboring regions with the global market. Its purpose is to unlock the region's significant export potential by creating a transparent, reliable, and efficient channel for international commerce.

The platform's core mission is to enable global buyers to source from the Bengal region with confidence through secure and seamless procurement. This is achieved by curating a verified ecosystem of suppliers and partners and by facilitating trusted transactions.

## 2.0 The Stakeholder Ecosystem

The success of any B2B marketplace hinges on its ability to create and deliver value to a multi-sided ecosystem. The Bay of Bengal platform serves the distinct needs of three core participant groups, with the platform's value proposition growing stronger as this network of stakeholders expands.

### Suppliers
- Bangladeshi manufacturers, traders, and suppliers producing a wide range of products and services ready for international export.

### Partners
- Local and international sourcing agents and buying houses that work directly with suppliers, providing essential expertise and logistical support.

### Buyers
- International B2B buyers and exporters seeking Bangladeshi products or services, ranging from small startups to large multinational enterprises.

A deep understanding of these stakeholders informs the two-phased strategic roadmap designed to attract, retain, and empower each group.
